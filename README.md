# sAMP-VGG16 : A short-antimicrobial peptides (sAMPs) prediction tool

## About
sAMP-VGG16 is a Python 3 application that implement transfer learning approach for predicting short-antimicrobial peptide sequences using connectivity information from CHARMM Drude polarizable Force Field. In this work, we present a transfer learning-based deep neural network model to predict AMPs, where we are using feature encoding based on Drude polarizable FF atom types, which will be able to capture the peptide properties more efficiently compared to conventional feature vectors. The proposed prediction model will be helpful in identifying AMPs with promising accuracy and efficiency.
